This is the official repository for the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) artifact specified in [ISO 21838-2:2020](https://www.iso.org/standard/74572.html), as well as the primary repository for the Basic Formal Ontology GitHub Organization. Here you will find the BFO User Guide, design patterns, implementations of BFO in formal languages, and artifacts used for validating BFO. 

BFO is a widely-used upper-level ontology that is conformant to the requirements specified in [ISO/IEC 21838â€‘1](https://www.iso.org/standard/71954.html) for top-level ontologies. Ontologies conformant to this standard promote interoperability among domain-level ontologies, thereby supporting the design and deployment of more specific ontology suites.

**Taking Time Seriously**
A long-standing issue among BFO users and developers has concerned how best to represent time. Importantly, issues concerning time in BFO stem from implementations of BFO in restricted formal languages. To see the issue, consider modeling a vehicle having an engine part at some time, but losing that engine part at another. 
Representing BFO using a language with the expressivity of, say, First-Order Logic, this could be expressed as - roughly:

    (1) has_part(vehicle, engine, time_1) & ~has_part(vehicle, engine, time_2)

In words, the vehicle has an engine part at time_1, but does not have an engine part at time_2. Here we have taken advantage of the fact that FOL allows using ternary relations; at most binary relations, however, are permitted in restrictive languages, such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL), in the interest of maintaining decidability of the language. This is to say, there is no straightfoward representation of the content of (1) in OWL. Given the need to represent time and change in many domains, proposals have been developed for representing such phenomena within the binary constraints of OWL. Examples include: 

A. Temporalized Relations - 
B. Temporally Qualified Continuants - 
C. Temporal Stases - 
D. Temporal Snapshots - 
E. Temporal Annotations - 

For each proposal, there are benefits and costs worth investigating. Each is a plausible avenue of research in the interest of more rigorous representations of time in restricted formal languages. More detailed expositions and details on current advances in these research projects can be viewed in respective 'Temporal Profile' repositories contained in the BFO GitHub Organization. 

Motivation for Temporal Profiles of BFO stems in part from recognizing that accurately representing time is more important in some domains than it is in others, to some users than it is others, and for some project goals than it is for others. For example, when representing the domain of mathematics - rather than the practice - a careful formalizatin of time is arguably not crucial. On the other hand, users in the [Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology Foundry](https://obofoundry.org/) have a need to represent time, and do so using a combination of BFO and the [Relations Ontology](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/ro.html). Nevertheless, OBO users have for many years employed a formally weak representation of time with great success. Indeed, a charitable reading of early [criticisms](https://github.com/cmungall/trel-crit/raw/master/trc.pdf) of the Temporalized Relations proposal, is simply that rigorous formalizations of time typically involve significant labor, retraining, tool development, etc., and OBO users do not have a need for such rigor. 

This is to say, that while 


BFO specified in [ISO 21838-2:2020](https://www.iso.org/standard/74572.html) includes temporal classes, such as One-Dimensional Temporal Region and Temporal Instant.
